# PowerShell Migration Summary

## Overview
This project successfully converted the entire setup process from legacy batch files to a modern PowerShell environment. The new PowerShell scripts are more robust, easier to maintain, and provide a significantly better user experience with enhanced error handling and interactive prompts.

## Key Benefits of PowerShell Migration

1.  **Robustness and Reliability**: PowerShell's advanced error handling and superior path management (especially for cloud-synced folders like OneDrive) make the setup process less prone to errors.
2.  **Improved User Experience**: The new scripts provide clearer, color-coded output, and interactive prompts guide the user through the setup process.
3.  **Maintainability**: The PowerShell code is more readable, structured, and easier to modify than the original batch files.
4.  **Flexibility**: PowerShell's scripting capabilities offer greater flexibility for future enhancements.

## Script Conversion at a Glance

| Old Batch File                  | New PowerShell Script           | Key Improvements                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `set_up_code_base.bat`          | `set_up_code_base.ps1`          | Main entry point, orchestrates the setup process.    |
| `clone_repos.bat`               | `clone_repos.ps1`               | Handles repository cloning and updates.              |
| `(N/A)`                         | `copy_from_PI-Shared.ps1`       | Manages copying files from the PI-Shared folder.     |
| `patch-installation_revised.bat`| `patch-installation.ps1`        | Applies patches and manages libraries.               |

## Testing and Validation
All PowerShell scripts have been thoroughly tested and validated to ensure they meet the project's requirements. The new setup process is confirmed to be fully functional and stable. The legacy batch files have been removed from the repository.
